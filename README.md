# Airplane Game

Originally known as Attack on New York, this is a computer game
from around 1985. My dad programmed it on an old Polish computer,
and I thought I'd have a go at recreating it for the browser.

Should be fully playable on mobile and desktop. Codebase is a mess, as
with any hacky project done in a few hours. Pure HTML5/Canvas/JS. Self-contained in a single HTML file.
